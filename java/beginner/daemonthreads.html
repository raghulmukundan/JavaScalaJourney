    <h1>Daemon Threads</h1>
    <h2>What are Daemon Threads?</h2>
    <p>
        Daemon threads in Java are a type of thread that operates in the background, providing support services to other
        non-daemon threads. The primary characteristic that differentiates a daemon thread from a non-daemon thread
        (also known as a user thread) is that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) does not wait for daemon threads to finish
        before exiting. If only daemon threads are running, the JVM will exit, stopping all daemon threads.
    </p>
    <h2>How to use Daemon Threads?</h2>
    <p>
        To use a daemon thread, you need to set a thread to be a daemon before it starts. This is done using the
        setDaemon(true) method of the Thread class.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a basic example:
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <div class="top-left copy-status">Code copied!</div>
        <button class="top-right btn btn-primary copy-button">Copy</button>
        <div class="top-right-expand btn btn-danger expand-button">Expand</div>
        <div class="code-content collapsed">
            <pre>
                <code class="language-java" data-loc="java" data-src="DaemonThreadBasic.java"></code>
         </pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>In this example, the main thread sleeps for 2 seconds and then finishes. The daemon thread, which prints a
        message every 500 milliseconds, will be stopped when the main thread exits.</p>

    <h2>When to Use Daemon Threads?</h2>
    <p>Daemon threads are used for background tasks that are not critical to the application's operation. Som eusecases
        include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><b>Garbage Collection: </b>The JVM's garbage collector is a daemon thread.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Background Monitoring: </b>Monitoring tasks that periodically check resource usage, log maintenance,
                etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Auto-Save functionality: </b>Periodically saving the state of an application.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Idle Resource Management: </b>Managing resources when the application is idle.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Resource Cleanup Example</h2>
    <p>In this example, we'll implement a more complex scenario where a daemon thread performs periodic resource
        cleanup.</p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <div class="top-left copy-status">Code copied!</div>
        <button class="top-right btn btn-primary copy-button">Copy</button>
        <div class="top-right-expand btn btn-danger expand-button">Expand</div>
        <div class="code-content collapsed">
            <pre>
                <code class="language-java" data-loc="java" data-src="DaemonResourceCleanup.java"></code>
         </pre>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p style="padding-top:15px;">
        In the above code, the cleanup daemon thread is periodically checking whether the resource is
        currently in use or not. If the resource is not in use, it prints a message indicating that it is performing
        "resource cleanup." However, in this specific implementation, the cleanup action is limited to printing a
        message and does not perform any actual resource management or cleanup operations.
    </p>
    <h3>Purpose of the Cleanup Daemon Thread</h3>
    <p>
        The primary role of the cleanup daemon thread in this code is to illustrate how a daemon thread can monitor the
        state of a resource and perform an action (in this case, printing a message) when the resource is not in use.
    </p>

    <h2>Potential Real-World Applications</h2>
    <p>In a real-world scenario, the cleanup action might involve more substantial tasks, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Releasing System Resources: </b>Closing files, network connections, or other system resources that are
                no longer needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Garbage Collection: </b>Explicitly removing unused objects or data structures to free up memory.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Logging and Monitoring: </b>Logging the state of the system or resources for monitoring purposes.</p
                </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Housekeeping Tasks: </b>Performing regular maintenance tasks such as clearing temporary files,
                resetting states, or updating status indicators.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pros and Cons of Daemon Threads</h2>

    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Resource Management: </b>Daemon threads automatically get terminated when all user threads finish,
                preventing resource leaks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Background Tasks: </b>Ideal for tasks that run in the background without affecting the main
                application flow.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>No Guarantees for Completion: </b>Since the JVM exits without waiting for daemon threads, they may not
                complete their tasks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Exception Handling: </b>Daemon threads should handle exceptions carefully as they may terminate
                abruptly without warning.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional points on Daemon Threads</h2>
    <h3>Thread Creation</h3>
    <p>
        When a thread is created, it inherits the daemon status of its parent thread. If the parent thread is a daemon,
        the newly created thread will also be a daemon unless explicitly set otherwise using
        <b><i>setDaemon(boolean)</i></b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Daemon Status</h3>
    <p>The daemon status of a thread is controlled by the <b><i>setDaemon(boolean)</i></b> method. This method must be
        called before
        the thread is started. Attempting to set the daemon status after the thread has been started will throw an
        <b>
            <i>IllegalThreadStateException</i>
        </b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Thread priority with Daemon Threads</h3>
    <p>
        Daemon threads have the same capabilities and characteristics as user threads, except for their role in the
        JVM's lifecycle management. However, like any thread, daemon threads can have priorities set using the
        <b><i>setPriority(int newPriority)</i></b> method. Higher priority daemon threads will be scheduled more
        frequently by the JVM
        thread scheduler.
    </p>
    <h3>Lifecycle and State of Daemon Threads</h3>
    <p>
        Daemon threads go through the same lifecycle and states as user threads: New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Timed
        Waiting, and Terminated. It’s important to handle their lifecycle properly to avoid resource contention and
        ensure proper exception handling.
    </p>
    <h3>Synchronization and Daemon Threads</h3>
    <p>
        Just like user threads, daemon threads can access synchronized blocks and methods. Proper synchronization
        mechanisms should be in place to prevent race conditions, especially when daemon threads perform background
        tasks that might interact with shared resources.
    </p>
    <h3>Exceptions in Daemon Threads</h3>
    <p>
        Exceptions in daemon threads can be tricky because the JVM does not provide a direct way to catch uncaught
        exceptions in daemon threads from the main thread. It’s important to handle exceptions within the daemon thread
        itself to ensure that the application does not fail silently. You can set an
        <b><i>UncaughtExceptionHandler</i></b> to catch
        and handle exceptions that are not caught within the thread.
    </p>
    <p>Here's an example:</p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <div class="top-left copy-status">Code copied!</div>
        <button class="top-right btn btn-primary copy-button">Copy</button>
        <div class="top-right-expand btn btn-danger expand-button">Expand</div>
        <div class="code-content collapsed">
            <pre>
                <code class="language-java" data-loc="java" data-src="DaemonThreadException.java"></code>
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Daemon Threads vs. User Threads</h2>
    <h3>Daemon Threads:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Support services in the background.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>JVM exits when only daemon threads are left.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Used for tasks like garbage collection, monitoring, background tasks.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>User Threads:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Perform main application logic.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>JVM waits for all user threads to complete before exiting.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Typically used for main tasks that require completion.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Avoid Critical Tasks in Daemon Threads: </b>Since the JVM does not wait for daemon threads to
                complete, avoid putting critical tasks in daemon threads.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Handle Exceptions: </b>Always handle exceptions within daemon threads to avoid silent failures.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Synchronization: </b>Use proper synchronization when accessing shared resources to prevent race
                conditions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Resource Management: </b>Ensure that resources held by daemon threads are properly released when the
                application exits.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Advanced Example: Daemon Threads for a Scheduled Task</h2>
    <p>Here’s a more advanced example where a daemon thread is used to perform a scheduled task:</p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <div class="top-left copy-status">Code copied!</div>
        <button class="top-right btn btn-primary copy-button">Copy</button>
        <div class="top-right-expand btn btn-danger expand-button">Expand</div>
        <div class="code-content collapsed">
            <pre>
                <code class="language-java" data-loc="java" data-src="DaemonTimerThread.java"></code>
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p style="padding-top:15px;">In this example, a Timer object is created as a daemon thread (new Timer(true)). It
        schedules a TimerTask to run
        at fixed intervals. The main thread sleeps for 10 seconds, allowing the daemon thread to execute the scheduled
        task periodically. When the main thread exits, the JVM will exit, and the daemon thread will stop executing.</p>

    <p>This example demonstrates how daemon threads can be used effectively for scheduled background tasks, ensuring
        they do not prevent the JVM from shutting down when the application completes.</p>

    <h2>Additional Considerations for Daemon Threads</h2>
    <h3>Impact on Application Design</h3>
    <p>When designing applications that utilize daemon threads, it's important to consider the overall architecture and
        how background tasks integrate with the main application logic. Here are a few more considerations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Graceful Shutdown: </b>Ensure that daemon threads can be stopped gracefully if needed. This might
                involve setting a flag that the daemon thread checks periodically to exit cleanly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Resource Management: </b>Daemon threads should release resources (like file handles or network
                connections) properly before exiting. This ensures that resources are not left in an inconsistent state.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Thread Pools: </b>When dealing with multiple background tasks, consider using thread pools
                (<i>ExecutorService</i>) with a mix of user and daemon threads for better control over resource
                allocation and
                task scheduling.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example: Graceful Shutdown</h3>
    <div class="code-container">
        <div class="top-left copy-status">Code copied!</div>
        <button class="top-right btn btn-primary copy-button">Copy</button>
        <div class="top-right-expand btn btn-danger expand-button">Expand</div>
        <div class="code-content collapsed">
            <pre>
                <code class="language-java" data-loc="java" data-src="DaemonGracefulShutdown.java"></code>
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p style="padding-top:15px;">In this example, the <b><i>BackgroundTask</i></b> class implements a Runnable that
        periodically prints a
        message. The stop method sets a running flag to false, signaling the thread to exit gracefully.</p>
    <h2>Integration with Thread Pools</h2>
    <p>We will go into Thread Pools later, but here is how to integrate Daemon threads with Thread pools. Daemon threads
        can be used within thread pools to manage background tasks efficiently. Here's how to create a thread pool with
        daemon threads:</p>

    <div class="code-container">
        <div class="top-left copy-status">Code copied!</div>
        <button class="top-right btn btn-primary copy-button">Copy</button>
        <div class="top-right-expand btn btn-danger expand-button">Expand</div>
        <div class="code-content collapsed">
            <pre>
                    <code class="language-java" data-loc="java" data-src="DaemonThreadPools.java"></code>
                </pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p style="padding-top:15px;">In this example, a custom <b><i>ThreadFactory</i></b> is used to create daemon threads
        within a
        thread pool. The <b><i>Executors.newFixedThreadPool</i></b> method creates a fixed-size thread pool, and tasks
        are submitted
        for execution. The main thread sleeps for 5 seconds before shutting down the executor service.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Daemon threads are a powerful feature in Java for running background tasks that do not prevent the JVM from
        shutting down. Understanding when and how to use them, handling their lifecycle properly, and being aware of
        their pros and cons are essential for effective multithreaded application design.</p>
