    <h1>Introduction to Concurrency</h1>
    <h2>What is Concurrency?</h2>

    <p>Concurrency is the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
        This doesn't necessarily mean that multiple tasks are being executed at the same exact time (that's
        parallelism), but rather that progress is being made on more than one task during overlapping time periods.
        In the context of programming, it means writing code that can handle multiple operations at once.</p>

    <p>
        For example, think of a restaurant kitchen where multiple chefs are preparing different dishes simultaneously.
        Each chef works on their own dish but also coordinates with others to ensure everything is ready at the same
        time.
        Similarly, in a concurrent program, multiple tasks are executed in overlapping periods.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Concurrent Programming</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><b>Improved Performance: </b> By utilizing multiple CPU cores, concurrent programs can perform tasks
                faster.
                For instance, a web server can handle multiple client requests at the same time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Better Resource Utilization: </b> Concurrency allows for better use of system resources.
                An example is a GUI application that remains responsive to user input while performing background tasks.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Enhanced User Experience: </b> Applications can perform long-running tasks in the background without
                freezing the user interface.
                For example, a file download application can download files while allowing users to navigate through the
                app.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Challenges of Concurrent Programming</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><b>Complexity: </b> Writing and debugging concurrent programs can be challenging due to the need to
                manage multiple threads or processes and their interactions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Race Conditions: </b> When two or more threads attempt to modify shared data simultaneously, it can
                lead to inconsistent results.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Deadlocks: </b> When two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources, leading to a
                standstill.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Resource Contention: </b> Multiple threads or processes competing for the same resources can degrade
                performance.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Threads vs. Processes</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><b>Threads: </b> A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads within the
                same process share the same memory space, which makes communication between them faster but also
                introduces the risk of race conditions and requires careful synchronization.</p>
            <p> <b>Example:</b> In a web server, each client request can be handled by a separate thread, allowing the
                server to handle multiple requests concurrently.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Processes: </b> A process is an independent program running in its own memory space. Communication
                between processes is slower compared to threads due to the isolation, but this isolation also makes
                processes safer from each otherâ€™s failures.</p>
            <p><b> Example: </b> Running a web browser, a text editor, and a media player simultaneously on a computer
                involves multiple processes, each in its own memory space. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><b>Web Servers: </b> Modern web servers like Apache and Nginx handle multiple requests concurrently using
                threads or processes, allowing them to serve thousands of users simultaneously.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Games: </b> Video games often use concurrency to handle different aspects of the game such as
                rendering graphics, processing user input, and running game logic in parallel. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Mobile Apps: </b> Many mobile applications perform background tasks like fetching data from the
                internet, syncing with servers, or processing images while keeping the user interface responsive.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
